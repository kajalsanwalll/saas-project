🚀 AI-Powered SaaS Platform (Next.js · Prisma · NeonDB · Clerk · Cloudinary)

A full-stack AI-powered SaaS application built using Next.js, designed with real-world product architecture and scalability in mind.

The project integrates Clerk authentication for secure user management and protected routes, Prisma ORM with NeonDB (serverless Postgres) for efficient database handling, and Cloudinary for advanced media uploads and optimization (images and videos).

The application supports AI-powered workflows, media uploads, and modern SaaS patterns such as middleware-based auth, server components, and API-driven features. The frontend is optimized using Next.js best practices, ensuring performance, responsiveness, and maintainability.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of production-grade SaaS architecture, including authentication flows, database modeling, serverless infrastructure, and third-party service integration.
